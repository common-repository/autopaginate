Automatically splits your longer posts into multiple pages on the paragraph boundaries.

== Description ==

Automatically splits your longer posts into multiple pages on the paragraph boundaries.

The plugin respects posts which have been manually paginated, and doesn't mess with your changes to the pagination which is automatically added. There is an option to "force pagination" which will override all current pagination and put in the page breaks according to the settings you've chosen.

To set the preferred number of words per page, see the new setting available in Settings > Writing in the WordPress administration screens.

Is this plugin lacking a feature you want? I'm happy to accept offers of feature sponsorship: [contact me](http://www.simonwheatley.co.uk/contact-me/) and we can discuss your ideas.
